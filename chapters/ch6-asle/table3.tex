\caption{Diffusive properties of the driving function obtained from the cluster
    perimeters of each percolation model studied. In the general case the the
    mean square displacement evolves like $\left\langle U_t\right\rangle\sim
    bt^\alpha$. We observe the isotropic percolation display regular diffusion,
    as expected, while multi-layered and directed percolation are
    superdiffusive and subdiffusive respectively. The multi-layered case used
    $\Delta=0.4$.}
