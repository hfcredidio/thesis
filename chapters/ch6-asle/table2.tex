\caption{Critical exponents $\bar{\nu}_x$ and $\bar{\nu}_y$ relative to the
    spatial scaling of the cluster perimeters in the three percolation models
    studied here. Literature values were taken from~\cite{Ziff1986, Dayan1991,
    Owczarek1997}. Isotropic percolation is the only one for which the
    exact value is know, $\bar{\nu}_x= \bar{\nu}_y= 4/7\approx0.571$. We
    estimated the exponents of each model using Monte Carlos methods, by
    generating cluster perimeters and using Eq.~[??]. We also estimated the
    exponents of their possible SLE$(b,H)$ (using the parameters given in
    Table~\ref{tab:param}). There's reasonable accordance between the exponents
    of multi-layered and isotropic percolation, considering the limitations of
    the method. Directed percolation, however, is not a match, suggesting that
    it may not be described by a SLE$(b,H)$.}
