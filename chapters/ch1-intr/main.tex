Let's make a bet. I'll take a checkerboard and throw a coin. If the coin falls
on heads I'll put a checkers piece in the first tile of the board, if it falls
on tails I'll leave it empty. The process is repeated for every tile of the
board successively until we end up with something the like board shown in
Fig.~??. Naturally the pieces are randomly distributed along the board, but due
to random chance some of them form dense clusters of neighboring pieces. We
consider two pieces as neighbors if are in adjacent tiles along the vertical or
horizontal directions, but not in the diagonal. Here are the rules of the bet.
If by the end of the coin-throwing process you can trace a path from the bottom
of the board all the way through the top passing only through neighboring
pieces you get, say, double your money. In other words, you win if it exists a
continuous cluster that connect the bottom and the top row of the board. If
there's no such cluster you lose all you've bet. There's a twist though, we'll
be playing in a gigantic $1,000,000$ by $1,000,000$ tiles checkerboard, instead
of the more traditional 8 by 8. How much money would you be willing to bet in
this game?
