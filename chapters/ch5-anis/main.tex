\chapter{Strongly Anisotropic Systems}
\label{ch5-anis}

By now it should be clear that the notion of scale invariance is a central
tenet of the modern narrative of critical phenomena. This principle show
its true power in the context of conformal invariance, that rely in the
assumption that a scale free system should be invariant under 

Several critical systems however are explicitly not scale invariant in its
strictest sense. These are systems out of equilibrium and 
Theses systems are called strongly anisotropic systems.

Most recently, experiments and simulations on fluid dynamics indicate
that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow belongs to the
universality class of directed percolation [???].

\section{Multi-Layered Percolation}
\label{sec:mlp}

Another universality class of strongly anisotropic phase transition is yet
another variation of the percolation model. Its aim is to model the structure
of stratified media, like layered porous rocks. Introduced by Dayan et al.\,
they suggested a percolation model for anisotropic multi-layered porous media
in which different layers may have different physical properties such as
density and porosity. Disordered systems such as layered fractured rocks are in
general anisotropic, i.e.\ physical properties such as density or porosity may
vary over the different layers.

In this model we take a $d$-dimensional lattice composed of several
$(d-1)$-dimensional sub-lattices (or layers) arranged in sequence, as if
they're stacked one over the other. Following convention, we'll call the axis
perpendicular to the layers the $y$-axis. We then perform the usual percolation
process by randomly occupying the lattice sites. The key difference here is
that each layer has its own occupation probability $p(y)$.
For simplicity, it is common to take a two-probability approach, where
each layer can have one of two values $p_1$ and $p_2$. These are
the control parameters of the model, where the line $p_1=p_2$ represent
the regular isotropic percolation. The larger the difference between
$p_1$ and $p_2$ the more accentuated if the anisotropy of the systems.
To this effect it is common to reparametrize the control parameter
by defining
\begin{equation}
    \bar{p}=\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\Delta=\frac{p_1 - p_2}{2}
\end{equation}
such that $p_1 = \bar{p} + \Delta$ and $p_2 = \bar{p} - \Delta$. 
The parameter $\Delta$ can take any value in the interval $[0.0,0.5]$,
and represents the degree of anisotropy of the system, which $\Delta=0$
is the isotropic case. 

As is expected, this model presents a second-order phase transition.
To determine the $\bar{p}_c(\Delta)$, Dayan et al.\ made use of the
cluster perimeter method.

We generate various cluster perimeters using the exploration method described
in Sec.~[???]. Making use of the fact that at the critical point a cluster
perimeter have equal chances of being an external or an internal border. We
generate several cluster perimeter and count the ration $R(\bar{p}, \Delta)$
between the number of realizations where the path was an internal perimeter and
the number of realizations where it was an external perimeter. The critical
point is such that $R(\bar{p}_c, \Delta_c)=1$. In the case of a square lattice
(the one studied by Dayan), we observe that there is a function
$\bar{p}_c(\Delta)$ that defines the border between the percolating and
non-percolating phases. This result can be seen in Fig.~[???]. Somewhat
surprisingly the same method was performed for the triangular lattice, and we
observed that $\bar{p}_c=0.5$ independent of the value of $\Delta$.

    layer (numbered $0$ through $9$ here) gets one of two probabilities of
    occupation ($\bar{p}\pm\Delta$), chosen randomly with equal probabilities.
    Otherwise, the percolation process goes as usual, occupying each site
    according to the probabilities of each layer.}

    nature of the multi-layered percolation makes itself evident even for the
    relatively low value of $\Delta$ used here.}

    $\Delta$, the more anisotropic is the system, and the multi-layered
    structure of the system becomes more evident.}
